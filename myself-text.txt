Welcome to my portfolio website! I'm excited to have you here. Let me introduce myself. I'm a 16-year-old student at HTL Villach IT, where my passion for technology has flourished. Since a young age, I've been captivated by various technologies, constantly exploring and learning about their intricacies.



One area of fascination for me is artificial intelligence (AI), but my interests extend beyond that. I find myself drawn to a diverse range of technologies, including embedded systems, back-end and front-end development, and design. Each of these fields offers unique opportunities for innovation and problem-solving.



As I continue my journey at HTL, I actively engage in personal projects that allow me to enhance my skills and broaden my technological knowledge. Whether it's coding, designing, or diving into the complexities of hardware, I derive immense joy from the entire creative process.



This portfolio website serves as a platform to showcase my experiences, projects, and growth in the world of technology. From developing cutting-edge software solutions to exploring the intricacies of AI algorithms and delving into the realms of back-end and front-end development, I am always eager to take on new challenges and expand my horizons.



Thank you for visiting my portfolio website, and I invite you to explore my work. If you have any questions or would like to collaborate on a project, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. Let's embark on this technological journey together!
